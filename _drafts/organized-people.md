## 7 Things Organized People Do That You (Probably) Don't Do ##

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlFGOSEI_lo&list=WL&index=6&t=0s

There are two ways to do something: right and again

Always return things to where you go them from when you are done using them

### The List ###

1. Don't Rely Solely on Your Brain to Store Information
=> put information in a system you can trust
        one that is not going to lose your data
        one that is easily accessible
        one that is well organized
        one that is searchable
        
2. Label all the things

3. Build a Mindfulness Loop
=> go through each of the dependencies in their lives and check up on them
=> Disorganized people constantly let life catch them off guard
=> consciously list out your dependencies 

4. Two is One, One is None
=> Have a backup of anything you use on a regular basis
        especially if running out of something in the middle of the day would screw it up
        e.g. batteries for mouse, charging cables, headphones, mouse, keyboard, gum
=> Improve you Bus Number
=> Identify and remove single points of failure
 
 5. Organize by Experience, not Dogma
=> base it on your experience or experimentation, not what other people do or say
        
6. Respect the value of _Mise en Place_
=> "Everything in its Place"

7. Be deliberate about what you own
=> Buy things that bring you value, joy or utility 
=> The more things you own, the more time you need to speed maintaining/storing/organizing them


Lateral Thinking
=> The process of solving problems using indirect lines of reasoning
