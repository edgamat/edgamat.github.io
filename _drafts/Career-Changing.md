The past year I have had the good fortune of working for a client on several projects.

The work has been very challenging and very rewarding. I told my boss that it was a career-changing
opportunity. He asked why. Here's what I came up with.

## Agile, no really.

I had only worked on one 'Agile' project using Scrum. It was run by a true Scrum Master and
I learned how little I knew about thinking and working in an Agile way. I worked on a few projects
after that one but they weren't run using Agile principles. People said they were using 'Agile',
but they really weren't.

The client practices an actual
Scrum process for managing their various software development efforts. It gave me the chance to see
how to work using Scrum and I learned how to manage my tasks in such a system. I'll never work
the same way again because I know how to work in a true Agile fashion. Agile is a state of mind and
not a process to follow. If you think agile, you can use Scrum to work effectively, providing value
each day.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

I had always tried to automate things on my ASP.NET projects, like building and running tests, but
never anything as ambitious as a true CI/CD pipeline. The client knew its value and put in the effort to
ensure that each code check-in was built automatically, had all unit tests pass, and then released
to a shared (development) environment for integration testing.

The Continuous Integration (CI) approach was very new to me as well. I had followed a Git Flow process
where changes were made to a 'Develop' branch, which would then be branched off to a 'Release' branch
prior to a final merge into the 'Master'. With CI, change were made in a branch and then, when ready,
merged directly in the 'Master' branch. Everything had to be ready to go to Production at all times.
The Project Manager said to all us contractors/developers that it would take getting used to, but it would
allow us to work together more effectively. And they were right. I don't think about the tasks I work on
the same way any longer. I work in smaller units of work at a time. I make sure each branch that I
submit as a Pull Request is small, cohesive, and ready for Production. Speaking of Pull Requests...

## Collaboration

I had never worked remotely with a group of developers before. Not really. I had work with remote teams
but never really collaborated with them. Since all the workers on the team were remote workers it
meant we had to find ways to share information and ideas differently than if we were all in the same
office together.

I felt the biggest part of that experience was submitting Pull Requests. In the past I had worked on projects
where Pull Requests were not used at all, and on projects where they were really just used to ensure that
developers could merge their code.

But on this set of projects, the Pull Request is a collaborative affair. It is the start of a conversation with your team on what the code does and to get questions asked, issues resolved and problems discovered and corrected. It's
a very powerful tool, one that I hope to use as much as possible on future projects.

## JetBrains Rider

In the past, I had used Visual Studio exclusively to build software. I had tried using Resharper, an extension
to Visual Studio, to help improve my coding efforts. But I found it was more trouble than it was worth. It's
intellisense was too intrusive and made it frustratingly slow to develop with. And I felt like the 'hints' it
suggested were things I could have/should have known without it's pestering me about at each keystroke. So
I gave up on it and never looked back.

So when the System/Technical Architect for the Client suggested I use an IDE based on Resharper instead of Visual
Studio, I was a bit apprehensive. JetBrains Rider was very foreign to me. It didn't have any of the keyboard
shortcuts that made me feel productive. It's integration with Git seemed less useful than the integration in
Visual Studio, but I decided to stick with it. When I got frustrated, I would switch back over to Visual Studio.

However, over time, I rewired my brain to use Rider more effectively. Little by little, I relied on Visual Studio
less and less. It many ways, it is a more effective IDE than Visual Studio. But in some ways it is not. So it
really depends on what you are used to. I see it now as a good alternative to Visual Studio, than a truly superior
tool. But what was really career-changing for me was how much it forced me to get out of my comfort zone and
try new things. Speaking of which...

## Architecture, 2019 Style

It has been awhile since I had been a Tech Lead on a project. I prided myself as serving as 'Software Architect'
on projects. These had all been .NET Framework 4.x projects build using ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework. Front
end work was accomplished using Knockout JS and JQuery. I tried to see what Single Page applications were like,
but never thought of using them on a real project.

This Client uses a significantly different architectural style to building applications an services. They took
a microservices approach to their architecture. At first I was very skeptical, thinking they were latching on
to the latest set of buzzwords. I could have not have been more mistaken. This group had already seen the value of
the microservies approach and used it effectively. So they were wanting to build out a quite of services to
provide new automation features to their end-users. And it was incredible to see it all come together.

It was career-changing for several reasons. One, it was something entirely new to me and it forced me to learn
a new way of reasoning about application architecture. That's not to imply that I think everything should be
built using this approach. But it made me realize how my own bias influenced my decision making when it comes
to architecture.

It also made me realize how little I know and how much I had gotten out of touch with software architecture
practices. It re-invigorated me to start learning again and trying to catch up. I don't feel like I will ever be stagnant again. My career moving forward will never be the same since I have realized how much value there is in being willing
to try new approaches and learn and learn and learn.

## Humility

Within my company, I was often told how 'smart' I was. I felt at times like I was the smartest person in the room
at times, which may or may not have been true. But my ego took a pounding in this last year. I feel like the work
I have done is of good quality and provided value to the Client. But I found myself at times being out-classed
by several people I worked with. They had different experiences, different approaches and better ways of doing things.

For the past few years, I had been working on several projects with the same group of people using the same set of technologies. I had grown to think in those terms only. I felt like I was truly mastering the technologies and
that made me more valuable. And because I wasn't working with anyone who challenged me, I began to 'believe my press'
and think I was smarter than others.

But on this Project, that all got turned upside down. I met people who were my equal in some areas and superior to
me in others. It was humiliating to submit a bunch of code I was proud of, only to see it questioned and analyzed
through the eyes of more capable people. And they were right. My code was not as good as it could be. It had all my
biases and flaws of years working in a bubble.

But these folks were compassionate and helpful with their feedback. That's not to say we say eye-to-eye on everything.
And we got into heated debates on more than one occasion. But it changed the way I see myself. It changed my approach
to the work. It made me realize how I need to do better.

## The Future

I have spent the last year trying to absorb as much as I can from these great people. I'll be sad when they, or I,
move onto to other things. I can't thank them enough for the opportunity and will hopefully let it reshape my career
and make me a better developer.
