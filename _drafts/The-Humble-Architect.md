Recently I re-read _The Mythical Man-Month_ and one section resonated with me. It described how an architect of a software development system should deal with the people that develop his or her vision. I think it defines The Humble Architect.

As anyone can tell you, having someone tell you how to do your job can feel like an attack. It can make you feel defensive. This holds true in a lot of situations including the software development world.

Any time someone suggests that your way of developing or designing a piece of software isn't as good as their way, you naturally want to defend your work. I often feel this was when the architect of the system I am working on critiques my work and wants me to change the approach I've taken. Knowing how that feels hopefully makes me empathize with other developers when I offer the same advice on their work.

When recently reading _The Mythical Man-Month_ by Frederick Brooks, he described a scenario when an architect challenges the estimate given by a developer charged with implementing the architect's designs. If the developer comes up with a higher estimate, the architect owes it to the developer to offer a possible implementation. That way, the developer can understand what the architect had in mind and how they formulated their estimate.

This sort of interaction occurs all the time. Not only between architect and developer, but between all members of a team developing software. But challenging a developer's approach (and resulting estimate of effort) can be, as Brooks states, "an emotion-generating activity". How does one defuse this situation and avoid conflict?

Brooks proposes that when an architect "challenges the builder's way of doing the builder's job", the architect must: 

- remember that the builder has the inventive and creative responsibility for the implementation; so the architect suggests, not dictates;
- always be prepared to suggest a way of implementing anything he specifies, and be prepared to accept any other way that meets the objective as well;
- deal quietly and privately in such suggestions;
- be ready to forgo credit for suggested improvements.

I offer this is a good initial description of **The Humble Architect**. Such an architect is good at designing software solutions, to be sure. But more than that, the Humble Architect is capable of communicating their vision and working with the builders to achieve that vision. They treat the builders with respect and are humble in their approach to giving feedback and suggestions. And just as important, they are open to recognizing the contributions others have to the overall design and the success of the project.

I have met a few Humble Architects in my career. I always admired their style and approach to interacting with their co-workers.
