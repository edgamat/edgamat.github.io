No matter what you do, there is an allowable tolerance for your work.

Allowable tolerance = accepted deviation from perfect

Accepted deviation from perfect, at some level is just a matter of taste.

Accepted deviation from perfect, at another level will have a direct impact on how something works/functions.

It really boils down to producing the appropriate level of quality in the appropriate level of time.


The final criteria on what an allowable tolerance is the expectation of whoever is signing your check. If you don't know what that criteria is for a given task then you better find out or your work might be rejected.
