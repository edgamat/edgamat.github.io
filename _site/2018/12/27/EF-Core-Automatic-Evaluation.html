<p>https://saebamini.com/the-dangerous-ef-core-feature-automatic-client-evaluation/</p>

<p>When using EF Core, the default configuration will not warn you (with a runtime error) if you 
are using a Linq query that EF Core cannot evaluate. This will result in the query being
run in a manner that might not be as expected. For example:</p>

<p>var query = context.Set<Blog>().Where(x =&gt; x.Url.Equals("google.com/", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
var results = query.ToList();</Blog></p>

<p>The overloaded Equals method with the StringComparison argument is not something EF Core understands. As
a result, the generated query has no WHERE clause and it retrieves all the records from the Blog table, until
a match is found. In other words, if you expected it to generate this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-SQl">SELECT BlogId, Url
FROM Blog
WHERE LOWER(Url) = LOWER('google.com/')
</code></pre>

<p>Or something similar, you are going to be disappointed. It actual generates this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-SQL">SELECT BlogId, Url
FROM Blog
</code></pre>

<p>To avoid this behavior, you can configure EF Core to throw a runtime error if it encounters something it cannot
covert into a SQL statement.</p>

<p>When configuring the options, set the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-CSharp">optionsBuilder
    .UseLoggerFactory(MyLoggerFactory)
    .ConfigureWarnings(warnings =&gt; warnings.Throw(RelationalEventId.QueryClientEvaluationWarning))
    .UseSqlServer("Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=EFCoreTests.NewDb;Trusted_Connection=True;ConnectRetryCount=0");
</code></pre>

<p>Then you will know when your EF-generated queries is not quite what you might have expected.</p>
