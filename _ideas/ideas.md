### What kind of content will you write?
“If you think something is clever and sophisticated, beware - it is probably self-indulgence.” - Donald A. Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

Your content should be unique, but it shouldn’t surprise your audience. Most successful blogs choose 2-3 standard "formats" and publish them consistently. Here are the most common formats I see on software engineering blogs:

+ **Tutorials** - These step-by-step walkthroughs show readers how to build something or illustrate a specific use-case for your product. They provide a lot of value to engineers who are using your tool or related technologies.

+ **Roundups** - Listacles get a bad wrap, but high-quality curation is still valuable when done right. Roundups bring together a wealth of information to help your readers make decisions.

+ **Case Studies** - Like tutorials, case studies can illustrate a use-case for your product, but they tend to be more focused on the outcomes than the process. Case studies can also come off as a bit “salesy” if you're not careful.

+ **Features** - Borrowing the word from journalism, a “feature” dives deep into something of interest to your audience. For example, you might introduce a new feature, highlight a team member, or do a technical teardown of part of your codebase.

+ **Q&As** - Interviews with team members, customers, and influencers in the industry can be a great way to focus your blog’s lense outwards and help you piggyback off your interviewee's audience.

+ **Comparisons** - Comparisons help readers decide between competing options. A good comparison post will offer an objective conclusion for which option is best under which circumstance.

+ **Opinion Pieces** - Personal experiences and observations help establish you as a thought leader. These pieces are valuable when done well, but require a bit of name recognition to pull them off.
