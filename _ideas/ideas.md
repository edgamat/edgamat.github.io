Captive dependencies is a kind of dependency injection anti-pattern that can lead to bugs in your code.
All you have to do to get a captive dependency problem is to inject a class with a shorter lifetime into a class with a longer lifetime. For example, inject a scoped service into a singleton. In this case, a scoped class will not be created and disposed per each web request. A scoped class will have the same lifetime as a singleton, and actually will become a singleton.

Dependency Injection Container Always Disposes Objects

```C#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton(new Service());
}
```

Flight Rules

Flight Rules are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals that list, step by step, what to do it X occurs and why. Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures.

Flight Rules protest against the temptation to take risks, which is strongest when momentum has been building to meet a deadline.

Standard Operating Procedures

101) When making a change to the code
102) When fixing a bug
103) When creating a Pull Request
104) When adding a feature not ready for production
105) When adding an endpoint
106) When adding a message consumer
107) When adding a message producer
108) When adding a log entry
109) When handling an exception
110) When adding an application setting
111) When modifying an application setting
112) When adding a health check
113) When adding a new table/view to an EF Core context (not owned by the project)
114) When adding a call to a stored procedure (not owned by the project)

201) When a build fails in DEV
202) When a deployment fails in DEV
203) When a deployment fails in TEST
204) When a nightly integration test fails
205) When a nightly security scan fails
206) When a deployment fails in PROD

### What kind of content will you write?
“If you think something is clever and sophisticated, beware - it is probably self-indulgence.” - Donald A. Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

Your content should be unique, but it shouldn’t surprise your audience. Most successful blogs choose 2-3 standard "formats" and publish them consistently. Here are the most common formats I see on software engineering blogs:

+ **Tutorials** - These step-by-step walkthroughs show readers how to build something or illustrate a specific use-case for your product. They provide a lot of value to engineers who are using your tool or related technologies.

+ **Roundups** - Listacles get a bad wrap, but high-quality curation is still valuable when done right. Roundups bring together a wealth of information to help your readers make decisions.

+ **Case Studies** - Like tutorials, case studies can illustrate a use-case for your product, but they tend to be more focused on the outcomes than the process. Case studies can also come off as a bit “salesy” if you're not careful.

+ **Features** - Borrowing the word from journalism, a “feature” dives deep into something of interest to your audience. For example, you might introduce a new feature, highlight a team member, or do a technical teardown of part of your codebase.

+ **Q&As** - Interviews with team members, customers, and influencers in the industry can be a great way to focus your blog’s lense outwards and help you piggyback off your interviewee's audience.

+ **Comparisons** - Comparisons help readers decide between competing options. A good comparison post will offer an objective conclusion for which option is best under which circumstance.

+ **Opinion Pieces** - Personal experiences and observations help establish you as a thought leader. These pieces are valuable when done well, but require a bit of name recognition to pull them off.
