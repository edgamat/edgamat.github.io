# Branding

A __brand__ is what a company means to people 

Brand words can describe:

- Your product and what it does
- Your customer
- Quality: top tier or every day
- Cost: Luxury item or bargain
- Accessibility and friendliness
- Your place in the market relative to others

--

Companies take ths very seriously

--

Know yourself, what makes you unique

--

Brent's Thoughts
2010 => Technical, approachable, likable
2020 => Pain-relieving, independent, irreverent

--

Exercise:

Pick 3 - 10 words that describe you

What you do, who you do it for, quality, cost, accessibility, availability, your place in the market, where you live, your hobbies

--

Unique, specific brands are strong

Easier to stand out in a crowd
Less people compete with you
Your message is easier to hear

--

Similar, general brands are weak

If you're trying to be the same thing that everyone else is trying to be:
- You have too many competitors 
- You have too low-priced of competitors
- You have to spend a fortune to get your message out

"I compete with Geek Squad, Microsoft support, huge consulting companies like IBM, and everyone in between"

--

You want 1000 true fans

You can't please everyone else

--

Your True Fans

- Will have their own version of your 3 words
- Will know what to expect from you (material, attitude clothes, hours)
- Will already know if they want to hire you
- Won't ask you to qualify yourself on a call (except for mgmt sign-off)

--

Your true fans are kinda your favorite coworkers

That is why it is so important to be honest and real with your 3 words: 
you're building your future friends circle.

--

Pick three words that stand out from the others, and mean the most to you.

--

These words are your Elevator Pitch

- Use them in a sentence or two
- Describe your service
- Be comfortable saying this out loud
- The content you build needs to convey these three words as much as possible

--

We are all imposters

- We're all always learning
- If you've stopped learning, that's the bigger problem

Just be clear about:
- What you've learned so far
- What your clients haven't learned yet

And now we gotta communicate it

--

Marketing is simply getting the public to know your three words

--

1. Picking a Brand Name

If you're only doing marketing part-time, your brand name has to be your own name

Sure, it's fun to think of funny stuff like @SQLSuperhero

But you don't have enough marketing resources to own that name outright

If you have a common name, use your full name

--

2. Getting people to memorize it

Outbound marketing: fast, but expensive gamble:

- Design ad campaigns telling people about your brand, emphasizing your brand words
- Buy a lot of ad space, and put your ads there

Inbound marketing: slow, but cheap and sure thing:

- Build valuable content that people want
- Building your brand image into that content
- People look for your content, learn your brand

--

When you know a topic well, you want inbound marketing

--

Inbound marketing tools

- Writing: blog posts, white papers, books
- Presentations at user groups, conferences
- Videos: podcasts, YouTube, streams
- Social: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn

The stuff you build has to convey your brand words

--

Put your brand in what you build

- Stories about experiences
- Code samples
- Pictures and art
- Topics

--

Outbound marketing is not subtle

--

Inbound marketing can't be subtle either

--

Doing inbound marketing

- Build things people want to consume

- Inside the things, include your brand words or themes

- Don't be afraid to repeat your brand words over and over and over....

--

Vendors want inbound marketing too

--

Give it away

--

What's your product?

--

When you're selling a book or video it's obvious

You charge for the product, but you give your time away

When you're trying to get a job, the product is you

=> Give away your work online, but charge for your time.

RECAP

If it can be given way for free, then someone will
If you can be the one giving it away, then you should. It's your marketing
Giving away knowledge, scripts, videos, etc. for free will build your reputation
Design a 1-year plan to build something you want to sell, and give away as much as possible along the way

When you get where you want, help others get there too.
