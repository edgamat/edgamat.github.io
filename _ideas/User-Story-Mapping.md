The original idea of a story was simple: use it to facilitate conversation:

someone who wants something: I've written on the card **what I want**

someone who builds something: We'll talk about it to discover **what I need to build**


Effective story conversations build shared understanding. 

The best documents use words and pictures to to help recall conversations, they don't replace conversations.

"Stories aren't a different way to write requirements, they are a different way to work."

A Story Map helps organize discussion about a user's experience with our product

Frame the idea (why build the product)
Understand users (what are their goals)
Map Use (from the user's perspective) 
Explore details (smaller steps, alternative steps, UI details, technical details)

A story map is a simple way to tell a story and break it down into parts

Build story maps in small collaborative groups

**Build shared understanding**

Use story maps to understand your whole product or feature's experience

Use mapping to break down big stories without loosing the big picture


Focus on outcomes

Delivering your hypothetical solution a piece at a time delays learning

Delivering minimal viable product tests to a smaller audience to find what's really viable


Takeaways

1. Tell stories, don't just write them
2. Use simple visualizations to anchor the stories you tell
3. Tell the whole story to find the parts that matter most
4. Think things through: minimize output, maximize outcome and impact
5. Build to minimal viable product tests to find what's minimal and viable in the market

Effective stories connect everyone to the purpose of your product
