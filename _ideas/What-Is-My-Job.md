I work as a software developer for a software company. Our mission is to provide our clients with value by understanding their problems, finding solutions and have fun in the process. But what is my job?

## Helping Others

I have worked for my company for almost 19 years. In that time, I have played several roles. Sometimes, I
have been an analyst and researcher. I have been a system architect, a tech lead, and a developer. Each of these 
roles had its own rewards and I enjoyed them all. But my passion has always been as a person who can help others.

My experiences have taught me a lot of lessons. I find it very rewarding to have the opportunity to share
those lessons with others. Some lessons are smaller than others, but no matter the size, I feel like I owe 
those who I work with to share the things I have failed at and changed over the years. Not only so they won't 
fail the way I did, but to ensure the longevity of our company's most valuable asset, our employees.

## Providing Value

Each day I look for ways to provide value to the people I work with. Most of the time, I work with a small team
of folks. Our job is to provide value to one of my company's clients. What those client's perceive as value
is the most important thing for me to learn. Once I know what they feel is valuable, I can align my work
towards the same thing. 
 
For example, a client may need a project to be done in 2 months. So they have brought me in to augment the
existing team. They value the completion of the project on time as the most important thing. So I ensure
my actions are aligned with that value and use that as a way to make decisions about what I work on 
and what not to work on.

As another example, a client may have an existing software system that they can no longer maintain. They 
have hired our company to replace the system with something more capable of supporting their business. I 
need to find out what their business is and how to ensure the new system can support them both now
and in the future.
