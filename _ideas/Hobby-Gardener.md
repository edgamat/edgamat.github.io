## The Hobby Gardener

I am a Hobby Gardener. At least, I think I am. I am not a farmer. I don't grow vegetables to sell to others. I don't rely on the vegetables I produce as the main source of food for me and my family. I grow vegetables because I enjoy it. I love the taste of fresh vegetables. I feel relaxed when I am out in the garden.

This year I start the fourth year in my garden. The last three years have gone well. I have had successes and failures. A lot of weeds. But I have learned a lot and feel like I am heading in the right direction.

This year I expanded my garden to be about as large as it can be for me to manage. I only get two to three hours a week to spend in the garden so I have to limit what I take on. My focus this year is to simplify my approach and to standardize much of what I do to avoid wasting time.

### The Garden Plot

My plot this year is contained within a fence that is 56 feet long by 28 feet wide. The garden beds are laid out as follows:

- One area 32 feet by 16 feet divided into 8 beds. Each bed is 3 feet wide and 16 feet long, with 1 foot wide walkways between each bed.
- One 16 feet by 4 feet bed
- Three 6 feet by 4 feet raised beds
- One area 16 feet by 14 feet divided into 3 beds. Each bed is 4 feet wide and 16 feet long, with 1 foot wide walkways.

This plot has evolved from just the three raised beds, and as a result, it hasn't been very standardized. Each bed was unique and nothing was the same width or length. So this year I made it a goal to redo all the beds to standardize them as much as I could in the given fenced area.

Each of the beds (raised beds not included) is standardized on 16 feet in length. The netting I use for trellis support is 16 feet long as well as the cattle panels I plan on purchasing this year. One package of seeds seems to be enough for a row. 

All the beds are 3 or 4 feet wide. These give me options for the types of crops I want to grow while still being easy to access and maintain the plants.

### My First Year

As I started down this journey of gardening as a hobby, my motivation was to help me relax. I was working in a high stress environment and felt I needed a way to reduce this stress in my life. 

I had been growing tomatoes for a couple of years in small containers on my deck and the thought of growing my own food appealed to me. My parents had always had gardens as I was growing up and I wanted to carry on the tradition. My goal was to grow all the vegetables my wife and I enjoyed in our salads: lettuce, cabbage, carrots, radishes and cucumbers.

In the fall of 2017, I fenced in an area 28 feet by 20 feet. On one side, I placed 3 raised beds 6 feet by 4 feet. I spent the fall filling them with home-made compost. In the spring of 2018 I added two raised tables for growing lettuce. 

In my first garden of 2018, I planted potatoes, carrots, bush beans, lettuce, radishes and snow peas. It was exciting but not without its challenges. I grew the most wonderful potatoes. By mid june I harvested all the potatoes and they were so amazing. The lettuce thrived and I even had a few radishes. My peas and carrots didn't fair as well. 

In the summer I grew some sweet peppers and they did okay. None of them really turned red. Most were harvested when they were green. But it was fun, none the less. I planted corn and they didn't produce anything. I also planted sunn hemp in one of the raised beds over the summer.

In the fall I planted cucumbers and winter squash and both did very well. I planted cover crops of cereal rye in a new area outside the fence in hopes of expanding the garden in the spring.

But then Hurricane Michael occurred. In mid October it forced us to evacuate for a week. When we returned I found our home was spared any damage. And the garden too was okay. 

### Year Two (2019)

Potatoes again
Wonderful carrots
Disappointing beans

### Year Three (2020)

### My Context

I have studied a lot of different approaches to gardening over the past 4 years. Several books and an enormous number of YouTube (tm) videos. What I have attempted to do is figure out what works for my environment. I know there is more than approach that will work in my garden. But I want to find one that makes the most sense for me. 

My goal is to keep the soil weed free and to allow the soil to recover after growing food:

1) Disturb the soil as little as possible, 
2) Keep it covered as much as possible, and 
3) Keep it planted as much as possible.

I have a total of about 1000 square feet of space to grow food. That is all I can manage at this time. I only visit the garden once per week and spend about 2-3 hours tending to the plants. I think in the future I might be able to expand the garden but at this time my focus is on efficiency in my existing garden. 

There are 12 beds in the garden and 8 of them are in use at any given moment. The remaining 4 beds are either covered with a tarp or are growing cover crops. So only 2/3 of the space is growing food. I also have 3 raised beds. I use these the same way. Only 2 of the three are growing food at a time.

I keep 6 containers around the deck/patio at the house. I use them for tomatoes, radishes and lettuce in the spring and snow peas and more lettuce in the fall. 

My year starts the first week in March when I plant my snow peas, carrots and potatoes. I grow two rows of potatoes and one row each of the peas and carrots. The carrots I grow in three batches, two weeks apart. This lengthens the harvesting window so I have fresh carrots for a longer period of time.

The first week after St. Patrick's Day I try to have my next set of plants in the ground: round two of the carrots and the first set of beans (two rows). Then the first weeks of April, I plant out the rest of the spring plants: cucumbers, winter squash, tomatoes and peppers. I spit these between the last two rows and the two raised beds. Oh, and the last round of carrots get planted too.

The last week in May is when I can start harvesting the potatoes, once they are done, I dig them up, and prepare the beds for sweet potatoes. Usually leave a week or two in between the end of the potatoes and the start of the sweet potatoes. But it depends on the weather and if the sweet potato slips are ready.

Everything else is usually is done (or unproductive due to the heat) by mid June. I follow up these spring crops with two summer crops of okra and southern (pink-eye) peas. I plant 1 row of okra and two rows of southern peas. Including the sweet potatoes, that's 5 rows total. Sometimes I'll use one or two of the raised beds instead of a row, it really depends. The goal is to only use about half of the space. The other half gets cover crops and tarps for the summer. 

While all this was going on, there are 4 additional beds being tarped and/or cover cropped. So I end up with the 4 beds I covered over the summer and these 4 additional beds for the fall growing season. I can usually start planting by mid-August to mid September. The rows/beds used for the southern peas, sweet potatoes and okra in the summer will rest during the fall and winter with cover crops and tarps.

My fall garden consists of carrots, snow peas, beans, cabbage, broccoli, and collards. I usually grow two rows of beans and half a row of collards. I plant carrots in the other half. Just like in the spring, I stagger the carrots plantings every two weeks to extend the harvesting period.

NOTE: There are many additional crops I'd like to try and grow: peanuts, corn, and parsnips. But until I have more time to experiment and mange these crops, I need to focus on the ones I get the most food value from.

Most of these fall crops will last all the way to spring if I let them. But by early December, most of them are done. I won't have time to grow cover crops so I'll tarp these beds until spring. But I like to try and grow carrots and collards/cabbage/broccoli in two rows through the winter. 

In the spring, these rows that have been growing through the winter plus two other beds, that have been worked hard, are covered until mid August. Tarps and cover crop rotations fo 6 months to get them rejuvenated and ready for another fall season.

The remaining beds have been covered since last August and are ready to start the new spring season all over again.

#### Bed Preparation

To prepare a bed for the first time, I mow down the grass as short as possible. Then using the tarp, I cover the grass for 4-6 weeks. I check on it each week to see how it is progressing. If there are fire ants under the tarp I spread some of the ant killer to keep it under control (can never remove them 100%, just have to learn to co-exist).

Once all the grass has died, I pull the tarp back and loosen the top 6 inches of soil with a digging fork. I have a super strong one just for this purpose. I also have a strong digging hoe I can use as well. I break up the soil, and flip any remaining grass over to mix it into the soil. I'll spread a bit of amendments on the soil and then plan a cover crop. I like sunn hemp and sudan grass, but I have also tried cereal rye and it works well. In the winter I have tried Austrian Winter Peas with Red Clover and it worked really well too.

The cover crop usually is ready to cut down in another 4-6 weeks, depending on the time of year. I have tried crimping it or using a hand sickle. But recently I found the best option is using a smaller saw-tooth sickle and cutting the plants down about an inch below the surface. As soon as I cut down all the bio-mass I break it down best I can. I have a sharp shovel I use for this, but I sometimes can use my lawn mower. The goal is to get as much of it broken down into smaller pieces.

Once this is done, I can either start another cover crop, or cover it with a tarp again for 4-6 weeks. In the winter some of the crops take much longer to grow. So it really depends on the context. But I keep repeating the cover crop, drop in place, incorporate, and tarp pattern until the bed is ready for growing vegetables again.
