### Identity Providers

An important aspect of securing your Angular app is choosing an Identity Provider. IdentityServer4 is very popular. It allows you to host it yourself and to customize to your needs. It is an ASP.NET Core application, so it is necessary to support that type of application in your infrastructure. Auth0 and Okta are two hosted providers and are very popular. They may not be as customizable as IdentityServer, but they can provide a lot of value if you need to get a solution up and running quickly.

### Courses/Tutorials

I have found these PluralSight courses extremely valuable. They each explained the topic well and included helpful samples and demos.
