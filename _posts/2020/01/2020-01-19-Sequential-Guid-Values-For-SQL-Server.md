As a developer, I design applications that are testable, easy to understand, and the best representation
possible of the real world concepts. I do not think of the database and its design with as much concern or care. 
Sometimes that causes performance problems that need addressing. Such an issue presented itself this week when
 using a GUID data type as the primary key of a table in SQL Server. Let's take a look at the issue and the set 
 of possible solutions.

## Background

I have come to favor using GUID data types for uniquely identifying entities in the core domain of
my software applications. This stems from a host of experiences, most notably, following a domain-driven design
and a Clean Architecture approach. Both of these philosophies relegate, to some degree, the database as an
implementation detail. As a result, relying on the database to provide the application with unique entity identifiers
 is not something I'm keen on doing. 
 
These days, many entities are not so tightly coupled to their persisted database representation. So using
a database to create the identifiers can be awkward. In addition, we need to have a reliable way of generating unique
identifiers that span multiple distributed applications (e.g. microservices). So using the traditional integer-based
identity columns in databases as unique identifiers has lost a lot of its appeal.

However, using an integer-based IDENTITY column in a database still has uses and shouldn't be dismissed outright. Log
files are a great example where using such a key is desirable. Anything written in sequence without needing to rely
on the IDENTITY for your domain model is fair game in my experience. For example, a persisted set of value objects
would be a good choice to use an integer-based identifier.

My preferences aside, it is clear that software designers are going to continue to use GUID values for uniquely identifying
entities and those entities will be persisted to databases.

## The Problem

My project was discussing changes to an existing table that used a GUID, generated by the application code, as a primary
key in a SQL Server database. Someone in the meeting who was very familiar with SQL Server's performance behavior asked
to look at the fragmentation of the primary key index on the table. When we checked, it was highly fragmented, over 90%.

The issue with highly fragmented indexes is a whole topic unto itself. I'll leave these links here as food for thought:

[GUIDs as PRIMARY KEYs and/or the clustering key][article1]{:target="\_blank"}  
[What are the best practices for using a GUID as a primary key, specifically regarding performance?][article2]{:target="\_blank"}  

As these article both demonstrate, the fragmentation was caused by the use of randomly generated GUID values for identifying 
each record in the table.

### Is this really a problem?

Before we look at the possible solutions, let's take a minute and think about the issue of index fragmentation. To some,
it isn't as big of an issue as others might make it seem:

[Should I Worry About Index Fragmentation?][article3]{:target="\_blank"}  
[Stop Worrying About SQL Server Fragmentation][article4]{:target="\_blank"}  

I guess my point is that anyone can go on the Internet and find evidence to support (or disprove) an opinion or idea.

As with most things, you must look at things in context, and with an open mind. In my situation, the table in question
has about 100,000 records now and will have a steady growth over time, probably into the millions. Optimizing the
performance of the clustered index to reduce fragmentation is something we should look at.

## Possible Solutions

To correct the issue, we could convert the clustered index to use an integer-based IDENTITY column. And that is 
a viable option for some situations. But in our situation, this would require a change to our approach and we'd prefer
a different solution.

One option would be to use the built-in SQL Server `newsequentialid()` function that can generate GUID values for
clustered index that don't cause fragmentation. Unfortunately, this would require the application to rely on
SQL Server to generate the identifiers, and we aren't in a position where that is a desirable solution.

Finally, we could change the routine the code uses to generate GUID values, opting for an approach that reduces 
the fragmentation of the clustered index. 

## Sequential GUID Values

To my surprise, generating a GUID sequentially is far from straightforward. I found several examples, some that
seemed to work, other not so much. 

To judge if the GUID generation logic would help with the SQL Server index fragmentation, I created a new table 
in a database that uses the same version of SQL Server as our application, SQL Server 2014:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[SampleValues](
    [Type] [nchar](10) NOT NULL,
    [SortOrder] [int] NOT NULL,
    [GuidValue] [uniqueidentifier] NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT [PK_SampleValues] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([GuidValue] ASC)
)
```

I set the default value for [GuidValue] to use the build-in `newsequentialid()` function:

```sql
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[SampleValues] ADD  DEFAULT (newsequentialid()) FOR [GuidValue]
```

I then inserted 10,000 records into the table, in batches of 100. The resulting clustered index had a fragmentation of 1.64 %
which I'll use as a baseline when comparing other methods.

I then removed the table and re-created it without using the default value for [GuidValue].

I used a C# program to generate the same sample of 10,000 values, in batches of 100. But this time, I used the default random GUID generation approach currently used by my software application:

```csharp
var newId = Guid.NewGuid();
```

The resulting clustered index had a fragmentation of 96.43 %. Definitely not a good choice.

NHibernate includes a 'COMB' algorithm to generate GUID values:

[https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/blob/master/src/NHibernate/Id/GuidCombGenerator.cs](https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/blob/master/src/NHibernate/Id/GuidCombGenerator.cs)

It describes its approach using a strategy suggested [Jimmy Nilsson's article](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=25862) on informit.com. 

Using the same test, it had a fragmentation of 18.64 %, but it also had a page fill of 51.28 % which is not as good as we'd like.

I discovered that EntityFramework (6.x and CORE) contain a SequentialGuidValueGenerator for GUID values:

[https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/master/src/EFCore/ValueGeneration/SequentialGuidValueGenerator.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/master/src/EFCore/ValueGeneration/SequentialGuidValueGenerator.cs)

The resulting clustered index had a fragmentation of 1.64 %, which matched the baseline exactly.

Surprisingly I found several other approaches claiming to mimic what the build-in `newsequentialid()` function does:

[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dbrowne/2012/07/03/how-to-generate-sequential-guids-for-sql-server-in-net/](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dbrowne/2012/07/03/how-to-generate-sequential-guids-for-sql-server-in-net/)  
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5585307/sequential-guids](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5585307/sequential-guids)  
[https://developmenttips.blogspot.com/2008/03/generate-sequential-guids-for-sql.html](https://developmenttips.blogspot.com/2008/03/generate-sequential-guids-for-sql.html)  

I found these all to be fascinating to research and explore. However, none of these approaches were superior to the `SequentialGuidValueGenerator`
provided by Entity Framework Core.

## The Solution

I feel like at this time, the best approach is to modify the code to use a dedicated class to generate the identifiers using the following
interface:

```csharp
public interface IGuidGenerator
{
    Guid NewGuid();
}
```

I'd refactor the code to inject (via a constructor parameter) an instance of the generator and replace all the `Guid.NewGuid()` calls:

```csharp
// replace
var newId = Guid.NewGuid();
// with
var newId = generator.NewGuid();
```

The first implementation I'd code would be the RandomGuidGenerator:

```csharp
public class RandomGuidGenerator : IGuidGenerator
{
    public Guid NewGuid() => Guid.NewGuid();
}

// Startup.cs
services.AddSingleton<IGuidGenerator, RandomGuidGenerator>();
```

This should have no impact on the current behavior and I can regression test that the refactoring has been successful. Then,
I'd introduce the new sequential variant, using the same logic as the `SequentialGuidValueGenerator`:

```csharp
public class SequentialGuidGenerator : IGuidGenerator
{
    private long _counter = DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks;

    public Guid NewGuid()
    {
        var guidBytes = Guid.NewGuid().ToByteArray();
        var counterBytes = BitConverter.GetBytes(Interlocked.Increment(ref _counter));

        if (!BitConverter.IsLittleEndian)
            Array.Reverse(counterBytes);

        guidBytes[08] = counterBytes[1];
        guidBytes[09] = counterBytes[0];
        guidBytes[10] = counterBytes[7];
        guidBytes[11] = counterBytes[6];
        guidBytes[12] = counterBytes[5];
        guidBytes[13] = counterBytes[4];
        guidBytes[14] = counterBytes[3];
        guidBytes[15] = counterBytes[2];

        return new Guid(guidBytes);
    }
}

// Startup.cs
services.AddSingleton<IGuidGenerator, SequentialGuidGenerator>();
```

Note the use of the `Interlocked.Increment` function. This ensures incrementing the counter is thread safe.

## Summary

The solutions here attempt to help reduce the fragmentation of clustered indexes based on GUID values. They do not focus
on creating truly sequential replacements for the integer-based IDENTITY columns. There will be gaps. Values generated
on different machines and hardware, while still sequential, may create groups of keys.

As I mentioned earlier, it's all about context. If you have a similar situation, the approach discussed here may not
solve it for you. Careful testing is the only way to know for sure if the selected approach is working as expected.
